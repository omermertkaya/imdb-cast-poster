## About The IMDB Cast Poster Download Web Page

This project developed to demand. The App will download your cast poster list. The app used simply nodejs for back-end and ejs for front-end. You know imdb api is not most expensive but maybe some people need to fastly and quickly download to cast poster. It worked for me. Thanks all.
